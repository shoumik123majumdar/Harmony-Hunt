# Spotle üéß - A Spotify Wordle Game

Spotle is a fun and interactive web app that blends the classic word-guessing game Wordle with your favorite music from Spotify. With Spotle, you can play a wordle-style game where the objective is to guess the name of a song based on progressively revealed clues. Whether you're into personalized playlists or popular public hits, Spotle has a mode for you!

## How It Works
You have **6 guesses** to guess the name of a song. After each incorrect guess, new clues are revealed to help you narrow down your answer:

1. **1st Guess**: Reveals the **song's genre**.
2. **2nd Guess**: Reveals the **release date**.
3. **3rd Guess**: Reveals the **artist's name**.
4. **4th Guess**: Reveals a **1.5-second snippet** of the song.
5. **5th Guess**: Reveals the **album cover**.
6. **6th Guess**: Final chance to guess the song!

If you guess correctly before the 6th try, you win! If not, you can still enjoy a **30-second snippet** of the song as a reward üé∂.
